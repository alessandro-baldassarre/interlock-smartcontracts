# Ethereum Contracts

This directory is where we keep contracts related to minting and managing the INTR ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard is well established and swappable, so any transactions having to do with minting and managing the actual ERC-20 INTR tokens will be done on the Ethereum blockchain. Clientside scripts to manipulate aspects of these contracts are found in the `client` directory within each listed contract type.
