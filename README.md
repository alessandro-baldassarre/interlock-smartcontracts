# Interlock Smart Contracts

Welcome! In this repository, we host development of all smart contracts that actualize our **token model** and **DeSec** infrastructure. Contracts are written in **ink!** on the Aleph Zero blockchain. These contracts are contained withing the _alephzero-contracts_ directory. This directory contains two NFT mints that we are using to license our Discord security bot called **Bouncer**. It also contains _ilocksupreme_ which is the collection of token and staking contracts, comprising the heart of Interlock blockchain activity. Alongside these two directories is one dedicated to client-side scripts. The other main space is the _contract-design_ directory, containing resources such flowcharts, plans, etc.

Before our move to Aleph Zero, we were developing for an Ethereum-Wormhole-Solana blockchain stack. All this work is available in _older-and-other_, for posterity.

The purpose of all this is to be transparent about our contract development.

We have enabled [discussions](https://github.com/interlock-network/INTR-smartcontracts/discussions) and will be open to feedback throughout the development process. Please feel free to chime in on a discussion or [issue](https://github.com/interlock-network/INTR-smartcontracts/issues), or reach out directly to blockchain engineer @blairmunroakusa on TG, Discord, or Github if you have anything direct.

Likewise, feel free to comment on issues as they come up. We use an org-wide labeling system, but will have specific labels for this repository to denote contract type, client tooling, etc.

Enjoy!
