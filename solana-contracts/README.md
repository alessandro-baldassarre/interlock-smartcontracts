# Solana Contracts

This directory is where we keep programs (smart contracts) written for the purpose of transacting with INTR on the main Interlock DeSec network. The cost of transacting is low on Solana, so this is where the majority of the smart contract staking and earning INTR transfers will take place. Like Ethereum, Solana contracts will contain a token mint to mint INTR on the Solana chain, via the Token Program. Without getting into the mechanism, before INTR can be swapped or exchanged however, it must be passed through Wormhole to Ethereum to convert it to the ERC-20 standard.
