# README remarks about this contract

The INTRsupreme contract handles $INTR business on the Solana blockchain. In particular, this is to include reward, staking, and tx fee functionalities.

INTRsupreme *might* contain mechanisms to handle $INTR transfer via wormhole, but these are more likely to be separate contracts.
