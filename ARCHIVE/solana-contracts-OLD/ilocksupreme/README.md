# README remarks about this contract

The ILOCKsupreme contract handles $ILOCK business on the Solana blockchain. In particular, this is to include reward, staking, and tx fee functionalities.

ILOCKsupreme *might* contain mechanisms to handle $ILOCK transfer via wormhole, but these are more likely to be separate contracts.
