# Aleph Zero Smart Contracts

This space is where exploratory smart contracts for the Aleph Zero Blockchain live. These contracts are written with the ink! language for Substrate.

The _ilocksupreme_ directory contains everything token and staking. In _ilockbouncernft_ are NFT contracts that Interlock uses to license the Discord security bot product Bouncer. Finally, the _ilockclient_ directory countains client-side scripts for manipulating contracts, and running tests. There is a directory that serves as a dump for all prior unused work, and this is called _olderandother_.
