# Aleph Zero Smart Contracts

This space is where smart contracts for the Aleph Zero Blockchain live. These contracts are written with the ink! language by Parity Substrate. These contracts form the foundation for all future Interlock contract work.

The `ilockmvp` directory contains the contract responsible for everything related to the Interlock minimum viable product, which consists of a PSP22 token, and functionality to distribute token rewards to interlockers who use the Interlock browser extension. `ilocknft` contains NFT contracts that Interlock will in part use to license the Discord security bot product Bouncer, and provide membership access to VIP areas. Finally, the `ilockclient` directory countains client-side scripts for manipulating contracts, and running tests. There is a directory that serves as a dump for all prior unused work, and this is called `ARCHIVE`.
